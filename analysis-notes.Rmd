# Data Analysis

This is to record what I did/what I plan to do so that I don't get confused and forget, and also for general organization and making this study replicatable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main question

Do changes in maternal care induce adaptive plasticity effects on offspring personality in wild North American red squirrels?

### Hypotheses & predictions

-   Changes in maternal care induces adaptive plasticity effects on offspring personality traits to prepare them for competitive environments

    -   Density cues will alter maternal care; direction unsure

    -   Red squirrel mothers experiencing high density cues will produce less active and more aggressive offspring, shaping them through maternal care style

-   These changes are adaptive

    -   We will observe better survival in individuals with low activity and high aggression in high density years

-   Sex-biased territory bequeathal (towards female offspring) causes LSR effects on aggression

    -   More females means more competition for the territory, which could in a more antagonistic nest environment and increase aggression

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DATA WRANGLING

### Personality

All juvenile personality data from the master file (n = 559 trials)

Filters:

-   Only those in JO, BT, KL, or SU (n = 534)

-   Those that did not indicate that they needed to be excluded/used with caution (n = 423)

-   Excluded Trial 1 for KL 2017-2018 squirrels as they were too young at the time, Trial 2 for squirrels that had 2 trials (n = 339)

-   Made sure each squirrel was counted only once (n = 275)

-   Removed the ones that had no OFT/MIS (n = 256)

Ran PCA using *ade4* package on the 256 remaining individuals

### Nest Attendance

### Used all available data (n = 824)

Filters:

-   Only used Nest 1 (n = 451)

-   Removed the observation with no observations (n = 450)

Set all \>420/NA latencies to 420 and coded the binary var of whether mom returned or not to "n"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Datasets:

master: includes everything (n = 256)

recent4: only 2018-2021 (n = 123)

no. of unique juvs with nest attendance data: 102

-   returned (y/n): 52/50

-   moved (y/n): 37/65

no nest attendance data: 154

all juvs in the tables have both oft and mis data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analyses

### Using master:

-   comparing control conditions

-   personality \~ maternal care/treatment

-   everything except...

### Using recent4:

-   maternal care \~ treatment

-   survival
