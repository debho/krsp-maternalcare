# Data Analysis

This is to record what I did/what I plan to do so that I don't get confused and forget, and also for general organization and making this study replicatable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main question

Do changes in maternal care induce adaptive plasticity effects on offspring personality in wild North American red squirrels?

### Hypotheses & predictions

-   Changes in maternal care induces adaptive plasticity effects on offspring personality traits to prepare them for competitive environments

    -   Density cues will alter maternal care; direction unsure

    -   Red squirrel mothers experiencing high density cues will produce less active and more aggressive offspring, shaping them through maternal care style

-   These changes are adaptive

    -   We will observe better survival in individuals with low activity and high aggression in high density years

-   Sex-biased territory bequeathal (towards female offspring) causes LSR effects on aggression

    -   More females means more competition for the territory, which could in a more antagonistic nest environment and increase aggression
